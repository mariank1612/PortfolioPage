    "about": "I started my career in finance, spending a lot of time in spreadsheets and SAP - and quickly realized that the biggest bottlenecks weren’t “numbers problems,” but system and process problems. What interested me most was making tools work better for the people behind them, so teams could spend less time on manual work and more time on decisions that actually matter.\n\nToday, I’m a Senior Business Consultant at BearingPoint, working with clients in the Telco, Media, and Technology space on digital transformation, automation, and AI-driven initiatives. I’ve worked on everything from SAP S/4HANA finance transformations to building automation tools that reduce repetitive effort. But what motivates me isn’t technology in isolation, it’s the collaborative work of aligning stakeholders, designing solutions that stick, and helping teams adopt change with confidence.\n\nI’m driven by curiosity and a belief that questioning the status quo works best when it’s done to help everyone thrive. Technology moves fast, and I enjoy the challenge of picking up new tools - not to master them in isolation, but to find better ways to solve the problems we face together.\n\nCurrently, I’m exploring how agentic AI and prompt-driven development can transform the way we build and deploy business solutions.",
